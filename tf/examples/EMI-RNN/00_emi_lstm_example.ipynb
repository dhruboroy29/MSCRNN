    "# Using EMI-RNN on the HAR Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple example of how the existing EMI-RNN implementation can be used on the HAR dataset. We illustrate how to train a model that predicts on 48 step sequence in place of the 128 length baselines while attempting to predict early. For more advanced use cases which involves more sophisticated computation graphs or loss functions, please refer to the doc strings provided with the released code.\n",

    "In the preprint of our work, we use the terms *bag* and *instance* to refer to the LSTM input sequence of original length and the shorter ones we want to learn to predict on, respectively. In the code though, *bag* is replaced with *instance* and *instance* is replaced with *sub-instance*. We will use the term *instance* and *sub-instance* interchangeably.\n",
