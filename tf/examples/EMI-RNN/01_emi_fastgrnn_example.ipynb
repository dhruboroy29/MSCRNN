    "# Using EMI-FastGRNN on the HAR Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple example of how the existing EMI-FastGRNN implementation can be used on the HAR dataset. We illustrate how to train a model that predicts on 48 step sequence in place of the 128 length baselines while attempting to predict early. For more advanced use cases which involves more sophisticated computation graphs or loss functions, please refer to the doc strings provided with the released code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preprint of our work, we use the terms *bag* and *instance* to refer to the RNN input sequence of original length and the shorter ones we want to learn to predict on, respectively. In the code though, *bag* is replaced with *instance* and *instance* is replaced with *sub-instance*. We will use the term *instance* and *sub-instance* interchangeably.\n",

An implementation based on FastGRNN - `EMI_FastGRNN` is used in this document, though the user is free to implement his own computation graphs compatible with `EMI-RNN`. This module expects two Dataset API iterators for $x$-batch and $y$-batch as inputs and constructs the forward computation graph based on them. Every implementation of this class defines an `output` operation - the output of the forward computation graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the trained model predicts on a smaller 48-step input while our test data has labels for 128 step inputs (i.e. bag level labels), evaluating the accuracy of the trained model is not straight forward. We perform the evaluation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the test data also into sub-instances; similar to what was done for the train data.\n",
    "2. Obtain sub-instance level predictions for each bag in the test data.\n",
    "3. Obtain bag level predictions from sub-instance level predictions. For this, we use our estimate of the length of the signature to estimate the expected number of sub-instances that would be non negative - $k$ illustrated in the figure. If a bag has $k$ consecutive sub-instances with the same label, that becomes the label of the bag. All other bags are labeled negative.\n",
    "4. Compare the predicted bag level labels with the known bag level labels in test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Early Savings\n",
    "\n",
    "Early prediction is accomplished by defining an early prediction policy method. This method receives the prediction at each step of the learned FastGRNN for a sub-instance as input and is expected to return a predicted class and the 0-indexed step at which it made this prediction. This is illustrated below in code. "
