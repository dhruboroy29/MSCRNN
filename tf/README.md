## Edge Machine Learning: Tensorflow Library 

This directory includes, Tensorflow implementations of various techniques and
algorithms developed as part of EdgeML. Currently, the following algorithms are
available in Tensorflow:

1. [Bonsai](../docs/publications/Bonsai.pdf)
2. [EMI-RNN](../docs/publications/emi-rnn-nips18.pdf)
3. [FastRNN & FastGRNN](../docs/publications/FastGRNN.pdf)
4. [ProtoNN](../docs/publications/ProtoNN.pdf)

The TensorFlow compute graphs for these algoriths are packaged as
`edgeml.graph`. Trainers for these algorithms are in `edgeml.trainer`. Usage
directions and examples for these algorithms are provided in `examples`
directory. To get started with any of the provided algorithms, please follow
the notebooks in the the `examples` directory.
